   abstract = {Smart home and artificial intelligence technologies are developing rapidly, and various smart home products associated with artificial intelligence (AI) improved the quality of living for occupants. Although some studies discussed the application of artificial intelligence in smart homes, few publications fully considered the integration of literature and products. In this paper, we aim to answer the research questions of “what is the trend of smart home technology and products” and “what is the relationship between literature and products in smart homes with AI”. Literature reviews and product reviews are given to define the functions and roles of artificial intelligence in smart homes. We determined the application status of artificial intelligence in smart home products and how it is utilized in our house so that we could understand how artificial intelligence is used to make smart homes. Furthermore, our results revealed that there is a delay between literature and products, and smart home intelligent interactions will become more and more popular.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces a new robotic smart house, Intelligent Sweet Home, developed at KAIST in Korea, which is based on several robotic agents and aims at testing advanced concepts for independent living of the elderly and people with disabilities. The work focuses on technical solutions for human-friendly assistance in motion/mobility and advanced human-machine interfaces that provide simple control of all assistive robotic systems and home-installed appliances. The smart house concept includes an intelligent bed, intelligent wheelchair, and robotic hoist for effortless transfer of the user between bed and wheelchair. The design solutions comply with most of the users' requirements and suggestions collected by a special questionnaire survey of people with disabilities. The smart house responds to the user's commands as well as to the recognized intentions of the user. Various interfaces, based on hand gestures, voice, body movement, and posture, have been studied and tested. The paper describes the overall system structure and explains the design and functionality of some main system components. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

It is designed to monitor these people so as to bring them more security and safety without disturbing their life. The living habits and behaviour of the elderly have thus been recorded with multisensor system. To be able to learn the habits of this group of people, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used. Thus any behavioural change can be diagnosed. The multisensor system along with the ANN methodology used for learning and some system functionalities are described. For one functionality, the results of habits learning are equally given.},

   abstract = {Since the emergence of the smart-home concept, many devices, interfaces and controllers have become available. However, there is a problem: each component usually performs a single function and there is no synchronization with other components. In order to exploit the great potential of the new technologies that these devices embody, as a base for synchronizing devices, interfaces and intelligent control systems, a universal model is required. The current paper offers a universal, comprehensive model for a smart home. Drawing upon existing protocols and technologies, it illustrates how to integrate different devices, software, and user interfaces to create a smart home. The model emphasizes four principles: A universal model can substantially lead to higher quality and usability of both devices and user interface; Production costs may be significantly reduced if manufacturers adopt a universal standard; The model synchronizes different groups of devices. This makes it possible to program complex scenarios leading to improved and enhanced smart-home utilization; Based on current available communication standards and infrastructure, the model can easily be installed in any house. Proposed smart-home architecture comprises - in addition to appliances and communication interfaces - a central management unit and a built-in database for smart equipment integration, for creating and implementing preprogrammed complex scenarios. The central management unit application and database store an up-to-date list of all connected devices. Any new integrated device is synchronized upon connection and removed when not in use. This is done automatically by sending any shared data (list of properties, commands, optional streaming, etc.) into the database upon initial connection.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to develop a multisensor data fusion technology-based smart home system by integrating wearable intelligent technology, artificial intelligence, and sensor fusion technology. We have developed the following three systems to create an intelligent smart home environment: (1) a wearable motion sensing device to be placed on residents’ wrists and its corresponding 3D gesture recognition algorithm to implement a convenient automated household appliance control system; (2) a wearable motion sensing device mounted on a resident’s feet and its indoor positioning algorithm to realize an effective indoor pedestrian navigation system for smart energy management; (3) a multisensor circuit module and an intelligent fire detection and alarm algorithm to realize a home safety and fire detection system. In addition, an intelligent monitoring interface is developed to provide in real-time information about the smart home system, such as environmental temperatures, CO concentrations, communicative environmental alarms, household appliance status, human motion signals, and the results of gesture recognition and indoor positioning. Furthermore, an experimental testbed for validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the smart home system was built and verified experimentally. The results showed that the 3D gesture recognition algorithm could achieve recognition rates for automated household appliance control of 92.0%, 94.8%, 95.3%, and 87.7% by the 2-fold cross-validation, 5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation strategies. For indoor positioning and smart energy management, the distance accuracy and positioning accuracy were around 0.22% and 3.36% of the total traveled distance in the indoor environment. For home safety and fire detection, the classification rate achieved 98.81% accuracy for determining the conditions of the indoor living environment.},
